abstract: This work adopts a Banach-valued time series framework for component-wise estimation and prediction, from temporal correlated functional data, in presence of exogenous variables. The strong-consistency of the proposed functional estimator and associated plug-in predictor is formulated. The simulation study undertaken illustrates their large-sample size properties. Air pollutants PM10 curve forecasting, in the Haute-Normandie region (France), is addressed by implementation of the functional time series approach presented.
